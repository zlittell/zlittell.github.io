I am a professional electronics design engineer. The product development process is something that I enjoy greatly. Turning a set of requirements into a product and having input on how that product will exist in the market is my speciality.  I have spent years doing the following activities:
* Schematic Design
* PCB Layout
* Firmware Development
* Circuit Board Testing (ESD, water intrusion, FTA)
* App Development
* Project Documentation
* Prototype assembly (by hand and by oven)

I hope to continue my career developing products that include electronics and being part of teams that are changing the markets they work in.
